### Computer Science
 - Computer Science from the bottom up - https://www.bottomupcs.com/
   - > Author: Yes as pointed out many times not 
"computer science" and I somewhat regret the name.  However, it came out
 of me being a teaching assistant for people doing computer science 
degrees.  A surprising number of people got to 3rd year operating 
systems courses without realising things like 2^10 is a kilobyte, 2^20 
is a megabyte, etc.  Let alone how a program was linked and loaded.  I 
hope for this to be helpful, there are plenty of similar resources but 
sometimes the way one person says something resonates more than another.

I deliberately wanted to avoid x86-only to illustrate for similar 
reasons.  Unfortunately Itanium proved to be a poor choice, ARM would 
have been better, but it gives me something to update if I get time!  
However, much of the basic content still remains relevant many years on.

   - > VTSAX is a Mutual Index Fund, Mutual meaning a combination of other indexes (e.g. Dow Jones) i.e. you're investing in the entire stock market, which grows as the economy inflates.


### NEWS & COMMUNITIES
 > All the news sources here are legitimate and very informative resources of information.
 - Hacker News - news.ycombinator.com
 - The Economist - economist.com<br/>
   - > 1. It's weekly. "World this week" section is more than enough to have a summary of what has happened throughout the globe and I can get this information in less than 5 minutes. If you are interested in being more up-to-date, you can also try Economist Espresso, which is daily.<br/>
   - > 2. It's not only about world news, but also has different sections such as Technology, International, Book & Arts which gives me a wider range of topics to digest on a weekly basis.
