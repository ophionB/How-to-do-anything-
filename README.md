## Work
Work is anything that you are compelled to do. By its very nature, it is undesirable.The
speaker draws a dichotomy between work and play, as he defines these 
terms, with work being things done under compulsion and play being 
things done based on desire (and especially passionate desire). His 
theme is a clarion call to shape your life, and the way you make a 
living, around things you love to do and to avoid dying a slow death by 
simply doing a job that makes money - the point being that it makes no 
sense to pursue modest comforts at the cost of spending your life doing 
soul-deadening things you don't like doing just because they earn you a 
livelihood. That is what "average" people do, and it is a pit that 
college kids facing life all fresh and ready should by all means avoid.

A few comments on this:

1.
 Hard work, even lousy forms of work, can be precisely the sort of thing
 that allows you to develop into someone who has the talent and 
character to be able to do the extraordinary things you might love. The 
prototypical person who has all the time and ability to pursue nothing 
but his passions, I would contend, is the spoiled heir, the person who 
has never had to work a day in his life in the way the speaker here 
defines work, i.e., as doing something that only a drudge or a drone 
would bother with. It is no secret that many persons of privilege of 
this type will wind up frittering away their lives with little focus or 
purpose and will never develop the character traits that would enable 
them to excel in life. They can pursue their "passions" all they like 
but, in the end, they stand a considerable risk of being spendthrifts, 
worthless heirs, or whatever other pejorative term captures what it 
means to waste one's life away in the name of pursuing passions without 
focus or purpose. Work - hard work, even menial work - is exactly what 
helps shape most people to rise above the frittering stage and to make 
something of themselves. For me, as a young kid and through my early 
adult years, it meant preparing myself for life's challenges by doing a 
whole host of things that I was "compelled to do" as the speaker uses 
the term: (a) enduring the drudgery of many parts of the education 
system itself, (b) selling papers, delivering donuts, working in a 
cannery, washing dishes, busing tables, waiting tables, tending bar, 
running delivery routes for a pharmaceutical wholesaler (yes, I know 
where most every pharmacy is in the Bay Area), (c) learning Latin on my 
own to help fill a deficit in my vocabulary and grammatical skills, (d) 
doing scut work to help meet family obligations, (e) working as a slave 
in a large law firm doing endless round-the-clock tasks of the dreary 
kind that young attorneys employed by large law firms often do (and 
quite a few other things to boot). Eventually, all these things led me 
to a position where I developed the skill and talent to do what I loved,
 and to do it well. But there was no short-cut to getting there. Work, 
pain, and adversity are an integral part of life and it is no loss - 
indeed, it is great gain - to spend some years doing things you don't 
necessarily love if they help shape your character in a strong way and 
if they help you develop skill sets that you can later apply in a more 
optimal way. It is called "growing up."

2. What most young people 
lack is not passion or intelligence but wisdom. That is, they do not yet
 know at their stage in life how best to apply the skills, 
talents, and strengths that they know they possess. They have a sense of
 what they want but insufficient life experiences to make right 
judgments about how best to proceed. In this sense, the old, dreary job -
 with all its limitations - is very often a good way to get out in the 
world and discover important things about yourself as you gradually grow
 and develop to face even more important challenges ahead (which, by the
 way, can consist of doing exciting things in the form of a job - not 
all jobs are dreary and many provide all the excitement and challenge 
one would expect even in a startup). I would add that merely deciding to
 "play" (as the speaker uses the term) can be decidedly dangerous in 
this sense because it assumes, very often contrary to fact, that the 
goals you want to play with are really worth pursuing - of course, they 
may be and I am all for those who want to throw themselves headlong into
 what they love doing, but many young people will simply not be equipped
 to make the sort of good judgment at an early age that they could make 
later after they have had a few working years under their belt. Wisdom 
combines intelligence with good practical judgments; to make good 
practical judgments, one needs to know life and not simply from the 
vantage point of a 22-year-old who normally has not yet developed to a 
fully mature stage.

3. Many people throughout the world do not 
have the privilege of completing a college education and it simply 
cannot be a rule of life that "play" is the operative way of doing 
things. Hardship and privation are everywhere in many large pockets of 
the world and people live life doing many things they wouldn't do if 
they had different circumstances. Often this takes the form of hard, 
manual labor, agricultural or otherwise. Can it be said that such a 
large segment of humanity is doing nothing ennobling but is merely 
spending life dying a slow death while living worthless lives because 
work is done of necessity? This to me comes off as exceedingly elitist. 
There is much in life that is precious and people everywhere share these
 things, whether they are forced to do things they don't want or not to 
earn a livelihood. My parents were immigrants who grew up in conditions 
of squalor. They couldn't wait to come to America to have the chance to 
better themselves, and they did. But they did so through incredible hard
 work of the type that the speaker here denigrates. To this, I say to 
him, "get out of your bubble and get a broader perspective."

4. 
All that said, I liked the punchy, colorful style with which the speaker
 presented his points and I can appreciate that the points made, and the
 manner of presentation, can cause young graduates to examine their 
premises and to think about what they really want to do with their 
lives. No one with even a modicum of ambition really strives to be 
average. On that broad theme, the speaker's points resonated with me. By
 all means, strive to rise above the mediocre. I would just take issue 
with the idea that hard work of even the "deadening" type is not an 
important part of that process.

## Computer Science
 - Computer Science from the bottom up - https://www.bottomupcs.com/
   - > Author: Yes as pointed out many times not 
"computer science" and I somewhat regret the name.  However, it came out
 of me being a teaching assistant for people doing computer science 
degrees.  A surprising number of people got to 3rd year operating 
systems courses without realising things like 2^10 is a kilobyte, 2^20 
is a megabyte, etc.  Let alone how a program was linked and loaded.  I 
hope for this to be helpful, there are plenty of similar resources but 
sometimes the way one person says something resonates more than another.

#### Networking
> Internet communication protocols are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IEEE handles wired and wireless networking, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) handles other types. The ITU-T handles telecommunication protocols and formats for the public switched telephone network (PSTN). As the PSTN and Internet converge, the standards are also being driven towards convergence
- Packets - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet
- Packet Switching - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching
  - Packet switching is a method of grouping data that is transmitted over a digital network into packets. Packets are made of a header and a payload.
 Data in the header are used by networking hardware to direct the packet
 to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by application software. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.

- Network Socket - [READ ENTIRE PAGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket)
- Protocol Stack - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack
  - > A protocol stack, today usually provided by the operating system
 (rather than as a separate library, for instance), is a set of services
 that allow processes to communicate over a network using the protocols 
that the stack implements. The operating system forwards the payload of 
incoming IP packets to the corresponding application by extracting the 
socket address information from the IP and transport protocol headers 
and stripping the headers from the application data.

- Packet sizes
   - > 

Yes, Packet size affect performance of network a lot.

First
 and foremost, every medium of transmission specifies MTU ie maximum 
transmission unit. If packet is more than MTU, it will be dropped.
Now question is how?

There
 is something called bandwith i.e maximum number of bits per second in 
order to guarantee reasonable level of reliability. Packet is single 
unit and considered to be transferred over small time. 
A larger 
packet will take long time to transfer resulting into more collisions at
 Layer 1. The medium of transmission i.e copper wire or twisted pair 
transfer electrons based on their mobility. This restriction affects the
 rate of data transfer over them. A large packet would mean others wont 
get chance to use transmission line
Apart from this restriction, 
buffers on NIC and OS have memory size restriction. A large packet size 
would mean large memory allocation at intermediate boxes as well as end 
hosts. If your packet size is large in high probability it will get 
dropped at queue whose element size is small or in worst case get 
fragmented (which is more computationally intensive then re transmitting
 in form of small packets).

A small packet size means large header content thus useful information would form less percentage of actual data transfer.
1000 byte data - as 1 packet - 1000+40(header) = 1040
1000 byte data as 20 packets - 1000+ 40*20 =     1800 byte.
Thus smaller packet size makes network inefficient by pumping more useless bits  an congesting it.
Thus standard size is set to 512 bytes, Ethernet has set up 1500 bytes. in advanced interfaces, it could go till 9000 bytes too

## SQL
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index
  - > The primary purpose of an index is to provide an ordered representation 
of the indexed data. It is, however, not possible to store the data 
sequentially because an insert statement 
would need to move the following entries to make room for the new one. 
Moving large amounts of data is very time-consuming so the insert
 statement would be very slow. The solution to the problem is to 
establish a logical order that is independent of physical order in 
memory.

 the rationality of belief. Much debate in epistemology centers on four 
areas: (1) the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification,[1][2] (2) various problems of skepticism,
 (3) the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, and (4) 
the criteria for knowledge and justification. Epistemology addresses 
such questions as: "What makes justified beliefs justified?",[3] "What does it mean to say that we know something?",[4] and fundamentally "How do we know that we know?"[5]

    - > Post-quantum cryptography (sometimes referred to as quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant) refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As of 2019,
 this is not true for the most popular public-key algorithms, which can 
be efficiently broken by a sufficiently strong quantum computer. The 
problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies 
on one of three hard mathematical problems:  the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.[1][2]

- Waveforms - https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/
  - > 

An audio wave is the vibration of air
 molecules, which is how sound travels. A waveform describes a wave by 
graphing how an air molecule is displaced, over time.

Amplitude
 is the strength of a wave's effect; the higher the amplitude, the more 
the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for 
the human ear; increasing a wave's amplitude will increase how loud it 
seems to us.

The most common periodic waveforms are the sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth.

These
 waveforms are said to be periodic because the wave they represent can 
be repeated to produce a constant tone. The faster the wave repeats, the
 higher the pitch of the sound.

Different
 waveforms have different harmonics. A harmonic is an additional 
frequency created by the wave. The sine waveform is unique in that it 
doesn't have any additional harmonics; it is the fundamental waveform.

To
 understand why certain waveforms have harmonics, we can attack the 
problem from the opposite end. Because the sine waveform is the 
fundamental waveform, it can be used to approximate all the other 
periodic waveforms, by just adding additional sine waves at the 
appropriate harmonics, and at the appropriate amplitude levels. In 
essence, a square wave can be thought of as an infinite number of sine 
waves, all happening at very specific frequencies and amplitudes.
