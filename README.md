## Computer Science
 - Computer Science from the bottom up - https://www.bottomupcs.com/
   - > Author: Yes as pointed out many times not 
"computer science" and I somewhat regret the name.  However, it came out
 of me being a teaching assistant for people doing computer science 
degrees.  A surprising number of people got to 3rd year operating 
systems courses without realising things like 2^10 is a kilobyte, 2^20 
is a megabyte, etc.  Let alone how a program was linked and loaded.  I 
hope for this to be helpful, there are plenty of similar resources but 
sometimes the way one person says something resonates more than another.

### TRADING
 - VTSAX  - Mutual Index Fund - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftMOJm8HXqk<br/>
   - > VTSAX is a Mutual Index Fund, Mutual meaning a combination of other indexes (e.g. Dow Jones) i.e. you're investing in the entire stock market, which grows as the economy inflates.


## NEWS & COMMUNITIES
 > All the news sources here are legitimate and very informative resources of information.
 - Hacker News - news.ycombinator.com
 - The Economist - economist.com<br/>
   - > 1. It's weekly. "World this week" section is more than enough to have a summary of what has happened throughout the globe and I can get this information in less than 5 minutes. If you are interested in being more up-to-date, you can also try Economist Espresso, which is daily.<br/>
   - > 2. It's not only about world news, but also has different sections such as Technology, International, Book & Arts which gives me a wider range of topics to digest on a weekly basis.

 ## Human behavior & Psychology
 - Tiny Habits - Tinyhabits.com
   - > The Tiny Habits habit formation 
regime created by Stanford researcher BJ Fogg. A lot of the addictive 
design patterns you see in apps like Snapchat, Instagram, etc. are built
 off his research. Quite nefarious use of psychology for 
advertising/“engagement”, but the plus side is you can use the same 
strategies to build habits you want to build.


## Privacy & Security
> Re-route and tunnel all connections on all devices to your home network through 'WireGuard' containing a net wide adblocker 'Pi-Hole' and 'VPN' over router, forward to dns resolver, use a 7-Layer Firewall named 'Little Snitch' to control incoming & outgoing packets. Spoof your 'MAC' adress, Use 'FireFox' or 'TOR' to browse the internet.

- Cryptography    
  - Post-quantum cryptography - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography
    - > Post-quantum cryptography (sometimes referred to as quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant) refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As of 2019,
 this is not true for the most popular public-key algorithms, which can 
be efficiently broken by a sufficiently strong quantum computer. The 
problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies 
on one of three hard mathematical problems:  the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.[1][2]
